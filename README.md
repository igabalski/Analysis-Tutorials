# Analysis-Tutorials

This repository contains a set of tutorial notebooks on Time-resolved X-ray scattering (TRXS) at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). These notebooks are intended for those who have some prior Python experience but are new to TRXS analysis. 

The notebooks run on Python 2, since this is still the dominant Python version at LCLS. Ideally, these notebooks should be run on the psana servers at LCLS to take full advantage of the psana analysis suite and data storage. However, it is possible to run some of these notebooks offline, provided you have a local copy of the data.
